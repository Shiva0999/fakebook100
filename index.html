<p>Facebook is an American online social media and social networking</b>
<i> service owned by Facebook, Inc. Founded in 2004 by Mark Zuckerberg</i>
<u>with fellow Harvard College students and roommates Eduardo Saverin, </u>
Andrew McCollum, Dustin Moskovitz, and Chris Hughes, its name comes
 from the face book directories often given to American university 
students. Membership was initially limited to Harvard students, gradually
 expanding to other North American universities and, since 2006, anyone over
 13 years old. </p></hr>

 <hr>Facebook can be accessed from devices with Internet connectivity, such as
 personal computers, tablets and smartphones. After registering, users can
 create a profile revealing information about themselves. They can post text,
 photos and multimedia which are shared with any other users who have agreed to
 be their "friend" or, with different privacy settings, publicly. Users can also
 communicate directly with each other with Facebook Messenger, join common-interest
 groups, and receive notifications on the activities of their Facebook friends and pages they follow.</hr>


 </p>
 <p >
 Nearly 1,000 students are enrolled annually in the Science and
 Management Stream. The students are drawn from different provinces,

 diverse culture and ethnicity allowing them to engage in intercultural
 understanding and to experience a rich learning. The school provides
 students with ample opportunities to engage in co–curricular and
 extra–curricular activities that ensure their holistic development which
 enables them to succeed not only in higher education but in life as
 well.

 <h3>2003–2006: Thefacebook, Thiel investment, and name change</h3>
 <p>
 Zuckerberg built a website called "Facemash" in 2003 while attending 
Harvard University. The site was comparable to Hot or Not and used "photos
 compiled from the online face books of nine Houses, placing two next to 
each other at a time and asking users to choose the "hotter" person".[17]
 Facemash attracted 450 visitors and 22,000 photo-views in its first four
 hours.[18] The site was sent to several campus group listservs, but was 
shut down a few days later by Harvard administration.

 <h3>2006–2012: Public access, Microsoft alliance, and rapid growth</h3>
 <p>
In May 2006, Facebook hired its first intern, Julie Zhuo.
 After a month, Zhuo was hired as a full-time engineer.[39]
 On September 26, 2006, Facebook opened to everyone at least 
13 years old with a valid email address.[40][41][42] By late 
2007, Facebook had 100,000 pages on which companies promoted themselves.[43] 
Organization pages began rolling out in May 2009.[44] On October 24, 2007, 
Microsoft announced that it had purchased a 1.6% share of Facebook for $240
 million, giving Facebook a total implied value of around $15 billion.
 Microsoft's purchase included rights to place international advertisements.
